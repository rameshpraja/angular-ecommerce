## Why did we build it?

We have been working with Spree for very long time, making products for a lot of clients. There was one pattern we noticed in what the clients always asked for. They were comfortable using spree for the backend [API](http://guides.spreecommerce.org/api/) but not for the front-end. These requests have been very consistent with so many awesome [front-end framework](https://github.com/showcases/front-end-javascript-frameworks) around.

When Angular team realeased the beta version in March last year we knew that angular was going to be a big player soon.
We decided to give it a try. Hence, AngularSpree was born as a front-end framework for the most awesome backend api for E-Commerce out there.

If you are looking to build a project similar to this one with all the ready-made setup, then I highly encourage you to look at this [starter seed project](https://github.com/aviabird/angular-seed) by [Aviabird Team](https://aviabird.com).

**[AngularSeed](https://github.com/aviabird/angular-seed) is a Plug and play Seed project built with ‚ù§Ô∏è using Angular 5, Redux/ngrx-store 4, Observables & ImmutableJs. We are commited to keeping this project upto date with all the latest versions of all the libs and components.**

## What in the Tech News?

We've built AngularSpree keeping scaling in mind leveraging the best technologies out there.

As of now, the application has 7 major modules, `products`, `core`, `home`, `user`, `checkout`, `auth`, `shared`.

We are working on documentation and we can share that once we are looking at a more stable release.

* Exclusively using @ngrx libraries(store, effects, actions), showcasing common patterns and best practices.
* Fully Observable approach using RxJS 5.0.1(latest beta).
* Uses @ngrx/store to manage the state of the app and to cache requests made to the Backend API, 
* @angular/router to manage navigation between routes, 
* @ngrx/effects to isolate side effects.
* @ngrx/actions to define the actions on the frontend.
* Following Container/Presentation component approach.
* Lazy loading of modules(for modules which are not immediately required for first painting the DOM).
* ImmutableJs to create and safeguard objects againts mutability.
* Project is divided into modules which are more or less independant of each other except core module.

__Current version of Angular is latest release [4.0.0](https://github.com/angular/angular/releases/tag/4.0.0).__

__Current version of Angular-cli is [1.0.0](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/releases/tag/v1.0.0).__

We try to make sure that we keep the repository upto date with the angular release every weekend.
